File structure is divided into SQL NOSQL and Schema Design
NOSQL further contains playground and main files
In SQL please execute triggers after creating tables as they have the logic to 
1) create verification request after inserting in accomodation table and
2) change accomodation status to rented once rental_transaction is created
